(if using MongoDB use mongoose as ORM, if using PostgresSQL you can use TypeORM, or you can use any other ORM as well)

## Submission Guidelines
- Include a README file that explains how to set up and run your application.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- User interface design and usability
- Proper integration of the authentication backend
- Functionality and completeness of the application
